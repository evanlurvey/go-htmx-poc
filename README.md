## Objective

I just wanted to learn go templating and htmx. Ended up exploring some other ideas including:

* automatic browser reload
* layouts / templates 
* components which are just functions
* automatic csrf
* automatic forms
* validations

## TODO

- menu bar based on login state
- header with name
- edit name menu

##### Tailwind

```console
# watch
tailwindcss -o app/static/style.css -w
# prod / ci
tailwindcss -o app/static/style.css -m
```
